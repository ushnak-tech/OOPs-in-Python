# OOPs in PythonðŸš€
### OOPs in python focuses on creating a reusable code so that we dont repeat ourselves. This concept is also known DRY(Do not Repeat Yourself).
### An Object Oriented Paradigm is to design the program with clasees and objects.

# Topics CoveredðŸš€
## Classes and Instancesâœ…
## Class Variablesâœ…
## Classmethods and static methodsâœ…
## Inheritanceâœ…
*  ### Method Resolution Order
* #### MRO is a concept used in inheritance. It is the order in which a method is searched for in a classes hierarchy and is especially useful in Python because Python supports multiple inheritance.
* #### In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right. This means that, first, the method is searched in the class of the object. If itâ€™s not found, it is searched in the immediate super class. In the case of multiple super classes, it is searched left to right, in the order by which was declared by the developer.
### `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` âœ…
## Special (Magic/Dunder) Methodsâœ…
* #### by defining our own special methods, we will be able to change some of the built in behaviours and operations
* #### `__init__()` is also the special method known as dunder init cus of double underscores
* #### `__repr_()` and `__str__()` are yet another two methods that allow us to change how our objects are printed and displayed
## Property Decoratorsâœ…
* #### Deleters
* #### Setters
